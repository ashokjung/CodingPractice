/*
* Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. 
* Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.
*   Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :
*   1. Extending the Thread class
*   2. Implementing the Runnable Interface
*   This demo is using Thread class  (Thread creation by extending the Thread class)
